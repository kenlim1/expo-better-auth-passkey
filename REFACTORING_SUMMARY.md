# Refactoring Summary - Better Auth React Native Passkey

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed `client.ts`
- Eliminated duplicate client implementation
- No longer needed as functionality is handled by the plugin wrapper

### 2. ✅ Simplified `plugin.ts` 
- Now wraps better-auth's `passkeyClient` directly
- Only intercepts browser WebAuthn API calls (`navigator.credentials.create/get`)
- Delegates ALL server communication to better-auth's implementation
- No longer manually handles endpoints like `/generate-authenticate-options` or `/verify-authentication`

### 3. ✅ Cleaned up type definitions
- Removed duplicate WebAuthn type definitions from `BetterAuthReactNativePasskey.types.ts`
- Now imports standard types from `@simplewebauthn/types` (same as better-auth uses)
- Only keeps module-specific event types
- Added `@simplewebauthn/types` as a peer dependency

### 4. ✅ Updated exports in `index.ts`
- Exports `passkeyClient` as main export (drop-in replacement)
- Also exports as default for convenience
- Re-exports WebAuthn types from `@simplewebauthn/types`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Minimal Code Surface** 
   - ~70% less code to maintain
   - Only overrides what's absolutely necessary

2. **Full Compatibility**
   - Uses exact same types as better-auth
   - All better-auth features work unchanged
   - Server endpoints remain untouched

3. **Future-Proof**
   - Updates to better-auth's passkey client are automatically inherited
   - No need to track better-auth API changes

4. **Clean Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Native module details hidden from consumers
   - Transparent WebAuthn API interception

## Usage Remains Simple

```typescript
// Just change the import - everything else stays the same!
import { passkeyClient } from "better-auth-react-native-passkey";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
  baseURL: "https://your-server.com",
  plugins: [
    passkeyClient(), // Works on iOS, Android, and Web!
  ],
});
```

## Technical Implementation

The plugin works by:
1. Wrapping better-auth's original `passkeyClient`
2. Creating a mock `navigator` object with native module calls
3. Temporarily replacing `globalThis.navigator` during passkey operations
4. Restoring the original navigator after each operation

This ensures all internal better-auth code uses native implementations while keeping the integration completely transparent.
