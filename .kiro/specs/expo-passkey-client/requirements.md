# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an Expo module that provides passkey authentication functionality for better-auth applications across web, Android, and iOS platforms. The module will serve as a better-auth client plugin called `expoPasskeyClient()` that mirrors the functionality of the existing `passkeyClient()` but is optimized for Expo/React Native environments. The implementation will keep native code minimal, handling only passkey requests and data return, while delegating complex logic to JavaScript. Web implementation will use SimpleWebAuthn, while native platforms will use platform-specific passkey APIs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using better-auth in an Expo application, I want to integrate passkey authentication, so that my users can authenticate using biometric or device-based credentials across web, iOS, and Android platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer installs the module THEN it SHALL be available as an Expo module with proper configuration
2. WHEN the developer imports the module THEN it SHALL provide an `expoPasskeyClient()` function that can be used as a better-auth plugin
3. WHEN the plugin is configured THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with better-auth's existing authentication flow
4. WHEN used on different platforms THEN it SHALL automatically use the appropriate implementation (web, iOS, or Android)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the module to have minimal native code complexity, so that it's easier to maintain and debug across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing native functionality THEN the native code SHALL only handle passkey creation and authentication requests
2. WHEN passkey operations complete THEN the native code SHALL return raw passkey data to JavaScript without processing
3. WHEN complex logic is needed THEN it SHALL be implemented in JavaScript rather than native code
4. WHEN errors occur in native code THEN they SHALL be passed to JavaScript with minimal transformation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web implementation to use SimpleWebAuthn, so that I can leverage a well-tested WebAuthn library for browser-based passkey operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on web platform THEN the module SHALL use SimpleWebAuthn for passkey operations
2. WHEN creating passkeys on web THEN it SHALL use SimpleWebAuthn's registration functions
3. WHEN authenticating with passkeys on web THEN it SHALL use SimpleWebAuthn's authentication functions
4. WHEN web operations complete THEN the results SHALL be formatted consistently with native implementations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the module to integrate properly with better-auth's dependency system, so that it doesn't cause version conflicts or installation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining dependencies THEN better-auth SHALL be specified as a peer dependency
2. WHEN SimpleWebAuthn is needed THEN it SHALL be included as a regular dependency for web support
3. WHEN the module is installed THEN it SHALL not conflict with existing better-auth installations
4. WHEN peer dependencies are missing THEN the module SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the expoPasskeyClient() to have the same API as the existing passkeyClient(), so that I can easily migrate or use familiar patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using expoPasskeyClient() THEN it SHALL provide the same public methods as passkeyClient()
2. WHEN calling registration methods THEN they SHALL accept the same parameters as the original passkeyClient()
3. WHEN calling authentication methods THEN they SHALL return data in the same format as the original passkeyClient()
4. WHEN integrating with better-auth THEN it SHALL work as a drop-in replacement for passkeyClient() in Expo environments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want native passkey implementations for iOS and Android, so that users get the best possible experience with platform-native authentication flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on iOS THEN the module SHALL use iOS native passkey APIs (AuthenticationServices framework)
2. WHEN running on Android THEN the module SHALL use Android native passkey APIs (Credential Manager API)
3. WHEN passkey operations are initiated THEN they SHALL trigger the platform's native passkey UI
4. WHEN native operations complete THEN the raw credential data SHALL be returned to JavaScript

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling across all platforms, so that I can provide meaningful feedback to users when passkey operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passkey operations fail THEN the module SHALL return standardized error objects
2. WHEN platform-specific errors occur THEN they SHALL be mapped to consistent error types
3. WHEN network issues affect passkey operations THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be provided
4. WHEN user cancels passkey operations THEN a specific cancellation error SHALL be returned

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the module to be properly structured as an Expo module, so that it integrates seamlessly with Expo development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the module is created THEN it SHALL follow Expo module conventions and structure
2. WHEN building for different platforms THEN the module SHALL compile correctly with Expo's build system
3. WHEN using Expo development tools THEN the module SHALL work in both development and production builds
4. WHEN the module is published THEN it SHALL be installable via npm/yarn in Expo projects
